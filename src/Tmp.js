          Anyway, get to know me! My name's Naufal Sani. I am studying Computer
          Science at{" "}
          <a className="university" href="cs.ui.ac.id">
            Universitas&nbsp;Indonesia
          </a>{" "}
          for now. This is my last semester! Looking for a job because
          University doesn't seem to be that busy now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I code in Python, Java, Dart (Flutter), and Web Necessary (HTML, CSS,
          Javascript). This website is created using ReactJS Library and
          managed/deployed on AWS S3 and managed Route53. <br />
          <br /> I tried using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with DNS + SSL
          managed at GCP. Thanks to my Uni who gives GCP credit to the students
          ðŸ˜† But since the GCP credit has ran out, I'm using AWS now. More cheap
          also!
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is currently being built by me to showcase what I've
          built. But for now, you can know me more from links below.
